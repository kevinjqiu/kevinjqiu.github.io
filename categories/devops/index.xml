      <description>I have been running my home DNS on a pair of RaspberryPi&amp;rsquo;s for some time now. The main reason for running my own DNS server is to utilize the excellent pihole project to block 3rd-party ads from being served to my home network.
I ansiblized the config files. It has been running great for a couple of months.
