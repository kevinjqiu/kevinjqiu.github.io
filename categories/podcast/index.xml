      <description>UPDATE: I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of great comments here and on reddit. Thanks everyone for the suggestions.
As software developers, we need to always keep learning and keep ourselves up-to-date with what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the industry. Listening to podcasts is a great way to do so for myself since I have a 2-hour commute every day. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m going to review software engineering podcasts that I frequently listen to and hopefully this post will be remotely useful to anyone looking for software podcasts.</description>
