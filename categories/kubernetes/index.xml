      <description>In the last part of this series, we learned how to do a basic deployment of a stateless service. You may ask what about our CouchDB service? How do we deploy a database which is innately stateful to a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes 1.5+ has introduced Stateful Set feature which makes this possible.
Stateful Sets According to the docs, a stateful set provides containers with the following:
 stable and unique network identifiers stable persistent storage ordered, graceful deployment and scaling ordered, graceful deletion and termination  For deploying CouchDB, we need to deploy a stateful set of CouchDB containers which allows us to attach a persistent storage to the container so our overmind service does not lose its data.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first part of my Kubernetes learning notes series. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to record my learning experience for deploying the overmind web service to a Kubernetes cluster.
The overmind web service is a simple and contrived microservice for managing zerglings. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you&amp;rsquo;re not a starcraft fan. The details of the web service doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter. The web service has a couple of endpoints, some of which involve talking to a database.</description>

      <description>Parts  Part 1 - Basic Deployment Part 2 - Deploy Stateful Services  Goals At $DAYJOB we&amp;rsquo;re moving away from our homebrew way of deploying and &amp;ldquo;orchestrating&amp;rdquo; docker containers to the promise land of Kubernetes. To solidify my learning, I&amp;rsquo;m going to practise what I learn by coming up with a hands-on project deploying a simple dockerized microservice with a database backend onto a Kubernetes cluster. Here are the Kubernetes features and 3rd party tools I foresee I will touch upon:</description>
