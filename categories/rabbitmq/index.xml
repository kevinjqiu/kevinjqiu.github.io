      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe the experience at $DAYJOB regarding implementing delayed retry using rabbitmq&amp;rsquo;s DLX combined with a TTL. The technique has been described at a few places but it is new to me personally and our company. I&amp;rsquo;d like to capture the experience we had both in implementing and in deploying to production.
The problem At $DAYJOB we have a service that integrates with a 3rd-party API that processes credit card payments and when successful, records a payment object on our customer&amp;rsquo;s invoices, and change the invoice status.</description>

      <description>Our company has &amp;ldquo;hack-off&amp;rdquo; days once a while, where we developers get to choose whatever we would like to work on and present it to the entire company by the end of the day. I have been hearing this websocket buzz for a while now and would like to build something interesting with it.
WebSocket Websocket is a persistent bi-directional connection between the browser and the server. With websocket, web browser can post message to the server, but what&amp;rsquo;s more interesting is that the server is able to push messages to the client (browser).</description>
