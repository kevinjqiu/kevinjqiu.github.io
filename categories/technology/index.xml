      <description>Migrating from wordpress to octopress
I&amp;rsquo;m not an avid blogger but like everyone else, I have a blog which I casually write about life and programming. Being hosted by wordpress, it was an out-of-the-box solution and comes with a lot of bells and whistles. However, for a programming blog, it has some significant shortcomings:
 Conflation of content and style. A Wordpress post is written in a weird combination of HTML markups and custom wordpress macros, which means you have to rely on their WYSIWYG editor to generate the correct markups, which means you can&amp;rsquo;t use your favourite editor to write a blog post.</description>
